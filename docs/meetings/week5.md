# Commute.ai - Planning week 5 (2025-10-20)

## What needs to be done

- [x] Fill the development diary
  - Avi will do it
- [x] What is the status?
- [x] User stories for week 5

## Notes

- Decided to use the same domain language as HSL
  - Itinaries contain legs
- Refined the itinary expansion user story
  - We decided to use a single itiniraries endpoint that will return AI descriptions for each leg of each itinary
  - Talked about the AI agents implementation that was still a bit open
- Discussed with Antti how to structure the AI agents repo and created a simple project-structure.md file
