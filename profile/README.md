# Commute.ai

> AI-powered public transport routing that optimizes for how you actually want to travel

## What We Do

Commute.ai is a mobile app that enhances HSL routes with AI-powered personalization. We learn your preferences (scenic vs fast, comfort vs efficiency) and use social media insights to suggest routes that match how you actually want to travel.
